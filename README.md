# The Sierpi≈Ñski Triangle and Chaos Game


In this demonstration I used the Image Processing Toolbox to animate the chaos game for a triangle and a square.

By choosing a random point and displacing it for 1/2 the distance from a random chosen vertex, you get for a triangle the so called Sierpinski triangle. 

For a square no fractal appears (1) and the interior of the square fills evenly with points. However, if restrictions are placed on the choice of vertices, fractals will appear in the square. The shapes shown (2 to 5) are all listed in the Wikipedia article:

Feel free to try this by yourself and ask questions, if you have any :)
